CRUDify is a powerful Project designed to simplify the process of creating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in your applications. With Api CRUDify, you can quickly generate API controllers, models, form request classes, migrations, and more, allowing you to focus on building your application's core functionality instead of writing repetitive boilerplate code.
